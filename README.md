## Arc Browser is Shit , I ~~made~~ making my own



## why?
i was looking through internet and i came to know about this new browser which came to replace LORD "Chrome" and i dig deeper and got to know about the team and what is the "core" idea of it , (  Arc was new at that time just started its development ) and I FUCKING LOVED IT, but as the time passes i started to feel that they are ruining the concept of arc and pushing too many features which certainly no one will even use after ones ( just after installing arc) and forget about it. and at that time  _Cough_ _Cough_ ""i thought i can do it better"" and i fairly working on UI design and left and never made it cause i was too packed with work.

 I was a windows user for too long and frustrated by default "WIN 11" ( cause it is shit ) which came with my new PC and that time i registered for Windows version or Arc, and GUESS!! what my "Win11"  got fried and i most of my data gone ( not the dev folder , _Cough_ _Cough_ I use GitHub for everything ),
 And Now "" *I USE LINUX BTW* "" fokes and few days back they send be invite for windows version of arc , and i am burned that they dont give WIN10 support and not even thinking on working for linux , **So i have to take the battle in my own hands** , and yaa i sated working on this the same day just for a *Proof of concept that i can make better and more useful things AND beautifully and with the feature which you will definitely use most of the days*
